For example, in image recognition tasks, you can rotate, flip, or adjust the brightness of the images. This way, the model sees more variations of the same data and becomes more robust."

From there, I'd prioritize features based on that and make sure everyone is on the same page.

So, when designing the system, I considered factors like the size of the training dataset, the complexity of the intents, and the trade-off between accuracy and computational resources.

UDP, on the other hand, is connectionless, and it doesn't guarantee delivery or order.

I think I would start by identifying the specific requirements of the protocol, like the type of data being transmitted, the expected latency, and the acceptable error rate.
